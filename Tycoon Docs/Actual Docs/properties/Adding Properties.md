# Adding Properties

Open the property file in the server folder `property_data.py`

First copy the first part of the code until where it says "Property data for this property ends here"

Then paste it again below the one you copied from

Then make sure you change the first part before the colon as this is the property name and must be unique

*** Make sure not to remove the single quotes and the property name can't be the same ***
