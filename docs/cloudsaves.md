# Cloud-saves
Once you are connected to a server, if the server supports cloud-saving and has your save data, you can retrieve it using a generated UUID, this UUID is used to retrieve your cloud saves and is randomly generated and is different from user to user

## Saving your save file to the cloud
Currently, the servers don't support uploading of cloud save files through the client, so you will need to contact a server administrator in order to save your cloud saves, the server does support loading save files from the cloud

## Downloading a cloud save file
When you are connected to the server, if an existing save file doesn't exist on your local computer, you will be asked to retrieve your cloud save file if you have uploaded one and tagged it with your Unique Identifier (UUID)
If one exists, the data will be downloaded and you will be asked if you want to store it on your device or not, if you choose the option to save it on your local device, you will be able to use it offline

## Deleting a cloud save file
To delete a cloud save file, give the server administrator your UUID, if one exists, it will be deleteds

## Updating your cloud save

Currently neither the server nor the client accept uploading your save file, so you will have to give your save file to the server administrator each time you make a change to the save file, the server will support uploading of save files once the app gets into its release stages however unless plans change.
